Dataset from Dartmouth's StudentLife studies.


From https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/datasets.html:

Three StudentLife datasets are associated with studying undergraduates at Dartmouth College.

First StudentLife Study: The first dataset is from the 2013 StudentLife study, with results published in a landmark ACM UbiComp 2014 paper presented by Rui Wang (now at Meta). This dataset captures 48 undergraduate students over a single 10-week term using Android phones. For the first time, it reveals the day-to-day and week-by-week impact of workload on stress, sleep, activity, mood, sociability, mental well-being, and academic performance. A second paper presented at ACM UbiComp 2015 by Rui Wang on academic performance from the same study predicted GPA within Â±0.179 of the reported grades. We talk about this dataset in detail below.

Second StudentLife Study: The second study followed 83 undergraduate students over two consecutive terms in 2016, utilizing smartphones and wearables to investigate the dynamics of depression and anxiety. Andrew Campbell presented the results in an ACM UbiComp 2018 paper, demonstrating that symptom features derived from phone and wearable sensors predict whether a student is depressed on a week-by-week basis with 81.5% recall and 69.1% precision. This dataset will be released this academic year.

Third StudentLife Study: The third study tracked over 200 undergraduate students from high school to graduation, providing invaluable insights into changing behaviors, resilience, and mental health in college life. Passive sensor data, surveys, and interviews were used to capture changing behaviors before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic subsided. The paper from this study will be presented at ACM UbiComp 2024. Other papers have been published using the dataset, including 1) an ACM UbiComp 2022 paper on the mental health of first-generation undergraduate students presented by Weichen Wang; 2) an ACM CHI 2022 paper comparing students' behavioral changes from the year before COVID-19 against the first year of COVID-19 presented by Subigya Nepal; 3) an ACM UbiComp 2020 paper on predicting brain functional connectivity from fMRI brain-imaging data and mobile behavioral sensing data presented by Mikio Obuchi; and 4) a Journal of Medical Internet Research paper on the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This dataset comprises fMRI brain-imaging, mobile sensing, EMA, and surveys. It is available for download on Kaggle.
